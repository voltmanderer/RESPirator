### Introduction

This is the repository for design files of an electronic respirator device made during the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic in the United States of America.

This is an open source project that anyone who wishes to manufacture and deploy the device will be able to.

The driving motivation of this project is to create a device that uses Electrostatic Precipitation to remove 95-100% of particulate matter from the airstream in real-time coinciding with the breathing needs of the wearer.

### Device goals

- Safe
- Easy to operate
- Easy to clean and sterilize
- Comfortable to wear for long periods of time
- Reliable
- Little to no reliance on filter materials (N95, FFP2, FFP3)
