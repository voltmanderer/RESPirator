RESPirator
This is the repository for design files for an electronic respirator device made during the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic in the United States of America. This project is intended to be completed and left under the Creative Commons Zero - 1.0 license so that anyone who wishes to manufacture and deploy the device will be able to. The driving motivation of this project is to create a device that uses Electrostatic Precipitation to remove 95-100% of particulate matter from the airstream in real-time coinciding with the breathing needs of the wearer. One goal of this device project is to make the device safe to use, easy to operate, easy to clean and sterilize, comfortable to wear for long periods of time, reliable, and using commonly acquired power sources with little to no reliance on filter materials that are technically complex to manufacture. - Andrew LeDoux 3/30/2020
